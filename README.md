# Low Maintenance Plants

## Background

To simplify the process of starting seeds and growing plants indoors. The system should automate tasks such as watering, lighting and heating to maintain optimal conditions.

## Roadmap

### Stage 1: Single Plant System

My first step will be to build an automated system to care for a single, maure, houseplant. This will limit the inputs, outputs and variables while I learn the problem space.
