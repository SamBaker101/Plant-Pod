# Plant Pod

## Background

To simplify the process of starting seeds and growing plants indoors. The system should automate tasks such as watering, lighting and heating to maintain optimal conditions.

## Roadmap

### Single Plant System

My first step will be to build an automated system to care for a single, mature, houseplant. This will limit the inputs, outputs and variables while I learn the problem space.

1. Water on timer
2. Water based on sensor
3. Light on timer
4. Temp monitoring
5. Heating based on temp control

## Plant Requirements

For this project I will be using a small dark leaved philodendron which Ive had in my home for about a year.

### Questions

- What is the optimal moisture level?
- Should a stable moisture be maintained or should the plant be soaked/allowed to dry?
- How much water would be used each day?
- What is the optimal temp?
- Best lighting spectrum?
- Best lighting duration?
